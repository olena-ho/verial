1. created the app with Vite
2. installed styled components
3. Set up BrowserRouter and Routes, added Outlet for nesting in the App.jsx
4. set up i18n, I18nextProvider in main.jsx and language switch in the Header

done:

- Header
- initial Home page
- global styles
- set up react-i18next for the multilingual website
- created pages for each of the 5 links in the nav, added them to the router
- created structure of Products and created pages for each product, added them to the router
- created dropdown component I use for the Products, Services and Resourses with two sides: items on the left and it's description on the right
- created carusel for the main page
- created the footer
- added arrows to the carousel on hover

plan for tomorrow:

- create pages for all the solutions, add them to the navigation
- add the subcategory solutions to the right part of the dropdown


to do:

- add hover color change and "see more" arrow to the right side items
- find a way for the Links to show the top of the new page opened (not the current scroll posotion)
- improve the right div of the navigation dropdown: make the background color stay of the left item while we are on its corresponding right side content
- add the links to specific subitems of the products on the right
- check if there are any things in the global styles that shouldn't be there and check if the individual styles repeat something from the global ones
- ask Juan about zip code of the office
