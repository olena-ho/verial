Verial new website frontend part only

1) created the app with Vite
2) installed styled components
3) Set up BrowserRouter and Routing in main.jsx and App.jsx

done:
- Header
- initial Home page
- global styles
- set up react-i18next for the multilingual website

plan for tomorrow:
- read about { Link } from "react-router-dom" and if I should use Link everywhere if I use router or not
- create pages for each of the 5 links in the nav, add them to the router
- create structure of Products and create pages for each product, add them to the router
- create dropdown for the Products


to do:
- make a dropdown for the products
- solve a bug - why the language switch fails when switching from Spanish to English the second time around and the url with English doesn't open the website with the English translation
- check if there are any things in the global styles that shouldn't be there and check if the individual styles repeat something from the global ones
