- created the footer
- added arrows to the carousel on hover
- added the "Overview" and "Your type of business" titles and subcategory items to the right part of the dropdown

plan for tomorrow:

- add hover and arrow to the selected item on the right, make the corresponding item on the left stay hovered 
- make the NavDropdown close on click


to do:

- find a way for the Links to show the top of the new page opened (not the current scroll posotion)
- make the cursor go back to normal when it's over Overview in the RightContainer in Navigation dropdown

- check if there are any things in the global styles that shouldn't be there and check if the individual styles repeat something from the global ones
- ask Juan about zip code of the office
