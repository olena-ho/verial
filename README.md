Verial new website frontend part only

1) created the app with Vite
2) installed styled components
3) Set up BrowserRouter and Routes, added Outlet for nesting in the App.jsx
4) set up i18n, I18nextProvider in main.jsx and language switch in the Header

done:
- Header
- initial Home page
- global styles
- set up react-i18next for the multilingual website
- created pages for each of the 5 links in the nav, added them to the router
- 

plan for tomorrow:
- read about { Link } from "react-router-dom" and if I should use Link everywhere if I use router or not
- create structure of Products and create pages for each product, add them to the router
- create dropdown for the Products


to do:
- check if there are any things in the global styles that shouldn't be there and check if the individual styles repeat something from the global ones
