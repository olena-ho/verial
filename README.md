Verial new website frontend part only

1) created the app with Vite
2) installed styled components
3) Set up BrowserRouter and Routes, added Outlet for nesting in the App.jsx
4) set up i18n, I18nextProvider in main.jsx and language switch in the Header

done:
- Header
- initial Home page
- global styles
- set up react-i18next for the multilingual website
- created pages for each of the 5 links in the nav, added them to the router
- created structure of Products and created pages for each product, added them to the router


plan for tomorrow:
- create dropdown component I will use for the Products, Services and Resourses:
  - first a simple dropdown and then make it more complicated with hovers and right / left sides


to do:
- check if there are any things in the global styles that shouldn't be there and check if the individual styles repeat something from the global ones
